Hi there! My name is Dylan Cooper and I'm graduating from the University of Virginia in the spring of 2019. I'm currently searching for a Software Engineering position, with experience in C++ and Python. When I'm not coding, I'm composing and performing music, hiking, and playing video games (my favorites are Smash Bros. and Overwatch).
